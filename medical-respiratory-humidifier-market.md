<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Respiratory Humidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical respiratory humidifier market comprises two main types: active and passive. Active humidifiers use heat and often integrate with ventilators to deliver warmed, moistened air directly to patients, ensuring optimal comfort and moisture levels. In contrast, passive humidifiers utilize exhaled breath to naturally humidify incoming air, relying on ambient conditions rather than artificial heating. Both types play crucial roles in treating respiratory conditions by preventing airway dryness, enhancing patient comfort, and improving overall respiratory care.</p></p>
